<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is technically a VERY VERY simple LINEAR(1D) visualization of how 
    laser operates in the time domain. The width and the height of the light waves and mirrors is just for
    visualization purpose.  Lens can't be supported just yet due to lack of vectors and dy/dx light wave elements.
    All reflections are perfect and do not lead to any heating of lens material. 
    This does not take into effect the energy transfer between the gain-medium(laser rod, gas, etc..) and the wavefront.
    It also does not take into effect the population inversion and the time needed to achieve a population inversion at a certain
    energy level.
</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This example laser is running CW mode.  Gain-medium charge times and flashlamp/capacitor discharge times are 
    not considered. (This would be a good analogy for a semiconductor laser, CO2, CW gas laser, halogen pumped solid state, 
    diode pumped solid state.)
</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> THIS IS NOT GOOD EXAMPLE FOR FLASHLAMP PUMPED LASERS OR Q-SWITCHED!
