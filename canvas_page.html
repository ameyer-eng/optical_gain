Your browser does not support the HTML5 canvas tag.</canvas>

<script src='classes.js'> </script>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The canvas tag is not supported in Internet
Explorer 8 and earlier versions.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is technically a VERY VERY simple LINEAR(1D) visualization of how 
    laser operates in the time domain. The width and the height of the light waves and mirrors is just for
    visualization purpose.  Lens can't be supported just yet due to lack of vectors and dy/dx light wave elements.
    All reflections are perfect and do not lead to any heating of lens material.
