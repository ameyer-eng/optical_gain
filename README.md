# optical_gain
A JavaScript animation of CW laser operation in time domain

## Simple example of CW laser

## Does not consider

1) Frequency domain issues such as bandwith and loss of photons @ improper wavelength
2) Flashlamp discharge illumination time
3) Thermal-gain issues difficulty maintaining population inversion due to heated gain material
4) Any sort of lenses or ability to concentrate/disperse the light
5) Q-switching
6) VECTORS....light waves need vectors
7) Diffraction
8) Modes as they exist in solid state materials
9) Probably a ton of other stuff
